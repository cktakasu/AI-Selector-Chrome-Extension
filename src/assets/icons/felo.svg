It provides strict security standards and richer feature permissions, fully leveraging the capabilities of Felo AI to help teams accurately obtain reliable answers and automatically generate office documents, thus greatly improving work efficiency and supporting efficient enterprise operations.","question_2":"What are the benefits of Enterprise?","answer_2":"There are many. Every knowledge worker needs to conduct tedious data searches, organize, summarize, and write reports in their daily work, each process consuming a significant amount of time. Felo offers richer feature permissions and more usage instances, allowing AI to easily generate research reports and work documents, enhancing team efficiency.","question_3":"How does Enterprise protect privacy and security?","answer_3":"Your data is secure, and the production and access of data in the internal knowledge base require organizational identity verification. Additionally, organizational data will never be used to train or fine-tune AI models. Our data protection agreements with third-party AI model providers like OpenAI and Anthropic also prohibit using Felo data for training. Your data always belongs to you.","question_4":"How can I use Enterprise to inquire about internal data issues?","answer_4":"You can connect the internal database to the knowledge base, allowing the search to output the results you want based on the team's knowledge base.","question_5":"How do I manage my team?","answer_5":"Organizations can freely add, invite, and delete team members, and can also flexibly allocate permissions to ensure that members in different roles have appropriate access and operational permissions."},"start_using":"Get Started","create_org":"Create an Enterprise","footer":{"contact_email":"If you have any questions, please contact us via email:","copyright":"All Rights Reserved.","download_app":"Download App"}},"enterprise":{"page_title":"Enterprise Pro","personal_account_title":"Account","enterprise_account_title":"Enterprise","pc_browser_required":"Please open felo.ai in a PC browser to proceed","create_org_title":"Create Your Organization","org_name":"Organization Name","org_name_placeholder":"Please enter your organization name","org_description":"Organization Description","org_description_placeholder":"Briefly describe your company to enhance the relevance of Felo's responses.","create_agree_terms":"I have read and agree to the terms and conditions","create_agree_privacy":"I have read and agree to the \u003cprivacy\u003ePrivacy Policy\u003c/privacy\u003e","create_safe_doc":"Safe Document","create_safe_doc_btn":"View Document","create_next_step":"Next Step","cancel":"Cancel","save":"Save","org_name_required":"Please enter your organization name","org_description_required":"Please enter your organization description","agree_terms_required":"Please read and accept the terms of service","agree_privacy_required":"Please read and accept the privacy policy","unsupported_image_type_tip":"Currently, only JPG, PNG, SVG, WebP, GIF image types are supported","minimum_seats_required":"The number of seats must not be less than {count}","create_succeed":"Organization created successfully!","create_succeed_desc":"Feel free to use Felo to enhance team productivity","create_succeed_item_1":"Add members to boost organizational productivity, \u003clink\u003einvite members\u003c/link\u003e.","create_succeed_item_2":"Organizational data is secure, and data will not be used for large model training, \u003clink\u003elearn more\u003c/link\u003e.","create_succeed_item_3":"Unlock all Felo features to assist in efficient enterprise decision-making, \u003clink\u003elearn more\u003c/link\u003e.","join_new_member":"Invite New Member","org_not_upgrade":"The organization has not upgraded to Felo ENTERPRISE, members only enjoy personal plan benefits.","input_member_email":"Please enter an email address","send_invite":"Send Invite","email":"Email","detail_desc":"Detailed Description","role":"Role","status":"Status","active":"Joined","invite_success":"Invite sent successfully","invite_failed":"Failed to send invite, please try again later","active_seats":"Current seat usage \u003cstrong\u003e{used}/{total}\u003c/strong\u003e.","input_email_tip":"Please enter a valid email address","invite_sending":"Sending Invite","member":"Member","remove_invite":"Remove Invite","seats_not_enough":"Insufficient seats, invited members will not be activated.","buy_seats":"Buy Seats","owner":"Owner","plan_title":"Choose Plan","plan_month":"Monthly","plan_year":"Yearly","plan_currency":"Payment Currency","plan_currency_placeholder":"Please select payment currency","month_pro_name":"ENTERPRISE PRO","month_unlimited_name":"ENTERPRISE UNLIMITED","plan_monthly":"Month","plan_yearly":"Year","plan_price":"Price","plan_seat_label":"Seat","plan_include":"Includes","plan_upgrade":"Upgrade Now","pro_month_benefit1_title":"Unlimited File Analysis","pro_month_benefit1_description":"Files are saved permanently, supporting up to 2 million words analysis","remove_org":"Remove Organization","cancel_admin":"Cancel Admin","set_admin":"Set as Admin","cancel_admin_success":"Admin canceled successfully","cancel_admin_failed":"Failed to cancel admin","set_admin_success":"Admin set successfully","set_admin_failed":"Failed to set admin","remove_org_success":"Organization removed successfully","remove_org_failed":"Failed to remove organization","setting_org_title":"Organization","setting_org_description":"Description","setting_org_bill_title":"Billing","login_to_accept_invite":"Please log in to accept this invite.","login_to_join":"Log in with email to join.","join_org_tip":"{name} invites you to join the organization.
